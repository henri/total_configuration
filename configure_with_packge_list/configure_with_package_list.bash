# 1.1 : Added basic support of arbitrary execution of downloads.
# 1.2 : Checks the version of installpkg when dealing with .dmg downlods.
# 1.3 : Basic support for configuration via environment variables.
# 1.4 : Minor bug fixes.
# 1.5 : Added support for installing files which are already accessible from the mounted file system. ( eg : file:// )
